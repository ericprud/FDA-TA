The attached files provide the RenalTransplantation and ComplicatedUTI
ontologies in a Turtle format. You can look at individual files to see how the intology is segregated. All of the files are concatonated into
  FDA-TA/tests/RenalTransplantation/built/protege.ttl
. Loading this will allow you to browse the ontology. In that view,
you should see a hierarchy like
  FDA-TA/RentalTransplant-cUTI-Observations-protege.png
. The prefixes indicate the ontology organization as well. You can
look at
  FDA-TA/RenalTransplantation-cmap.svg
in a web browser. Hovering over the nodes and arrows will bring up
tooltips showing the corresponding or property class in the ontology.

These files are also available at https://github.com/ericprud/FDA-TA .
I may be able to improve RenalTransplantation-cmap.svg over the
weekend.
