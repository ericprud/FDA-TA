# Each patient has a complicated UTI (cUTI).  Joe also has acute pyelonephritis.
# 
# Each is treated with a given StudyDrug.  Each as multiple urine cultures assessed by either Sponsor or Investigator.  In the case of Sponsor assessment, the opinion of the Investigator is overridden.
# 
# Each patient has a target microbial population that is the focus of treatment.  Population is classified via a) baseline pathogen (name); b) region of origin of pathogen; c) stratified infection category (ascending route of infection (ascending pyelonephritis), hematogenous route of infection (e.g. endocarditis)
# 
# Effect of treatment (microbiological outcome) is calculated based on a combination of presence of new infection, superinfection, persistent infection, and clinical outcome
# 
# Drug information:  dose, frequency, route of administration, concomitant antibiotics
# 
# Lab test info:  sample viability, pathogen species, pathogen count, WBC, nitrate concentration, urine nitrates, luekoesterase, pathogen genotype/phenotype, 
# 
# Joe :  
# S/sx – malase, back pain, fever, dysuria, urinary urgency, urinary frequency
# Complicating factors – indwelling catheter, neurogenic bladder
# Has both blood and urine specimens send for culture and sensitivity
# Clinical outcome -- indeterminate
# 
# Bill :
# S/sx – chills, flank pain, groin pain, urinary urgency, urinary frequency
# Complicating factors – male urinary retention
# Has urine specimen send for culture and sensitivity
# Clinical outcome -- indeterminate
# 
# Deb :
# S/sx – chills, flank pain, vomiting, lower quadrant pain, CVA pain, change in mental status, suprapubic pain
# Has both blood and urine specimens send for culture and sensitivity
