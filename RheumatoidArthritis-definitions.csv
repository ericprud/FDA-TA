Anti-CCP	Anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibodies are autoantibodies (antibodies directed against one or more of the individual’s own proteins) frequently detected in rheumatoid arthritis patients. During inflammation, citrulline is incorporated enzymatically into proteins[1], what is called citrullination. Recently, these ACPAs have turned up as powerful biomarkers, which are accepted as a major diagnostic tool in diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) already in a very early stage of disease.

Rheumatoid Factor	Rheumatoid factor (RF or RhF) is a blood test performed in patients with suspected rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is an auto-antibody directed against the Fc portion of IgG, which is itself an antibody. RF and IgG form immune complexes, which are part of the disease process (serum sickness) of various rheumatological diseases.	LOINC: 6928-6	C0035448	=		search.loinc.org
TNF inhibitors biologics	"Biologics are genetically engineered proteins derived from human genes. They are designed to inhibit specific components of the immune system that play pivotal roles in fueling inflammation, which is a central feature of rheumatoid arthritis. They differ significantly from traditional drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis in that they target specific components of the immune system instead of broadly affecting many areas of the immune system.\nTNF inhibitors are drugs that inhibit the production or activity of a Tumor Necrosis Factor. This process may result also in inhibition of some functions of mature immune cells, including polymorphonuclear chemotaxis and monocyte phagocytosis. Tumor Necrosis Factor suppression is intended to favorably modulate functions of the immune system."	http://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/biologics	C1519686	<		http://www.arthritistoday.org/arthritis-treatment/medications/drug-guide/search-by-condition.php?v=9&condition=Rheumatoid%20arthritis

MTX (Methotrexate)	An antimetabolite and antifolate agent with antineoplastic and immunosuppressant activities. Methotrexate binds to and inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, resulting in inhibition of purine nucleotide and thymidylate synthesis and, subsequently, inhibition of DNA and RNA syntheses. Methotrexate also exhibits potent immunosuppressant activity although the mechanism(s) of actions is unclear.	http://ncim.nci.nih.gov/ncimbrowser/ConceptReport.jsp?dictionary=NCI%20MetaThesaurus&code=C0025677	C0025677	=

Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Patient Global Assessment 	"Scales maybe recorded using a 0-10 scale or a visual analog scale 0-100 mm, or may be recorded using descriptors such as ""well"" or ""poor""."	https://www.rheumatology.org/Practice/Clinical/Rcr/Disease_Assessment/	C21120	 <		
Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Physician Global Assessment	Maybe recorded using a 0-10 scale or a visual analog scale 0-100 mm, or may be recorded using descriptors such as “remission, low disease activity, moderate disease activity or high disease activity”. The Physician global assessment can take into account several factors such as the presence of joint pain, duration of morning stiffness, degree of fatigue, functional status, objective evidence of disease activity (i.e., synovitis, as assessed by tender and swollen joint counts, and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) level), mechanical joint problems (i.e., loss of motion, crepitus, instability, malalignment, and/or deformity), the presence of extraarticular disease, and the presence of radiographic damage.	https://www.rheumatology.org/Practice/Clinical/Rcr/Disease_Assessment/	C21120	 <

Disease Activity Score (DAS28)	Disease Activity Score 28 is a mathematically calculated, continuous, composite endpoint with differential weighting given to each of the following components: tender joint count (28 joints), swollen joint count (28 joints), acute phase reactant, and patient global assessment of arthritis.	FDA Guidance for Industry, p.3, foot note	C2711347	 <		"DAS28 assess the number of swollen and tender joints and measure the ESR. The DAS28 provides you with a number on a scale from 0 to 10 indicating the current activity of the rheumatoid arthritis of your patient. A DAS28 above 5.1 means high disease activity whereas a DAS28 below 3.2 indicates low disease activity. Remission is achieved by a DAS28 lower than 2.6 (comparable to the ARA remission criteria).\nThe DAS28 has additional utility in measuring the level of disease activity at a given timepoint, whereas the ACR response criteria are calculated as improvement in the variables over a set period of time (relative improvement)."
Health Related Quality Of Life (HRQoL)	"Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and its determinants encompass those aspects of overall quality of life that can be clearly shown to affect health—either physical or mental. On the individual level, this includes physical and mental health perceptions and their correlates—including health risks and conditions, functional status, social support, and socioeconomic status. On the community level, HRQOL includes resources, conditions, policies, and practices that influence a population’s health perceptions and functional status.\nHRQoL questions about perceived physical and mental health and function have become an important component of health surveillance and are generally considered valid indicators of service needs and intervention outcomes."	http://www.cdc.gov/hrqol/concept.htm	C0451401	 <
